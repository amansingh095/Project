                                interesting reading and reiterates that determination finds favour with God and brings
                                endeavours to fruition. Please accept the heartiest felicitation from A2Z on completion
                                of two fruitful decades of IASDS. I am sure that the Institute will continue to serve
                                the public by illuminating statistical research under your able stewardship.

                                There is something very special about you and it becomes almost impossible for anyone
                                not to be influenced by it. I am sorry that I could not be there from the beginning but
                                it was very important for me to listen to the proceedings. Values are fast fading and I
                                was able to see it in you and thats enough for me to have liked every bit of the day.
                                Congratulations!!! I will be away for 10 days but I will give you a call once I am back.

                                I am glad that IASDS will give such a strong emphasis to the role of primary health care
                                – as a route to equity, prosperity, and social stability. These are the larger rewards
                                of better health.

                                We had invited Professor A.K. Nigam to the Academy to help us in rendering the
                                statistical advice for finalizing our All India Report on Land Refprms. He is extremely
                                knowledgeable and his presence in the workshop would be very helpful for the future of
                                this project.
